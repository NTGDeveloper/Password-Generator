# Chaney's Secure Password Generator
I made this for my Computer Science class, so I figured I should share it.
## Features

 - Simple Mode (generates a strong password between 8-12 characters)
 - Fully customizable generation technique
 - Uses ASCII character system
 - Runs under Python 3 interpreter for efficiency
 - Open-Source (but that's obvious)

## Why?
Because I want to. Simple as that.
